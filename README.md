# Assignment
ChatBot assignment
A Houndify based chatbot which supports self defined Mercedes-Benz usecases using the Connected Vehicle API.



How to start the Application
Run python client_main.py, the file is located in the top level directory.

Using
The application should be self explanatory:

we can chat by typing into the textbox at the bottom
one can speek to the system after clicking on the buttom with the microphone symbol
(TTS is not supported yet)
Dependencies
The application uses pyaudio which is based on portAudio (needs to be installed on the OS).
QT5 should be installed such that it can be used by the PyQt5 python package
for the other dependencies it should be sufficient to pip install requirements.txt
Usecases
Mercedes-Benz specific usecases exploit the Connected Vehicle API, therefore the following car domains are supported:

information about tires, doors, location, odometer, fuel, state of charge
command to (UN)LOCK doors
The information requests are specified as generic as possible on Houndify, therefore a sentence like

"What is the status of my < car-domain >"
"Could you given me information about my < car-domain >"
"How are/is my < car-domain >"
should work for tires, doors, fuel, etc.

For locking the doors try:

"please tell Mercedes to lock my car"
Implementation approach
From a technical perspective five steps had to be done:

employing the Houndify SDK/API (TextClient & AudioClient)
defining custom Mercedes-Benz Connected Car usecases on Houndify
building a python wrapper for the Mercedes-Benz Connected Car REST API and define how to present the vehicle specific usecases to the user
building the GUI with QT5 (QT5 Designer for the basic static layout and PyQt5 to add chat bubbles dynamically at runtime)
and of course putting everything together (includes debugging, logging, getting crazy here and there ;) )
